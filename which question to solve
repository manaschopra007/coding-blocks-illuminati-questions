/*Three close friends, Petya, Vasya, and Tonya, have formed a team to participate in programming contests.
The contest organizers offer several problems for the participants to solve.
Prior to the contest, the friends agreed that they would only implement a problem's solution if at least two of them are confident in solving it. 
 If not, they would not attempt to solve the problem.
 For each of the n problems offered in the contest, the friends have information about which of them are confident in solving it.
 We need to help the friends determine how many problems they will solve based on this information.

There is only 6 questions on which atleast 2 of the three contestants agree. They are question no 1,4,6,7,8,10*/
