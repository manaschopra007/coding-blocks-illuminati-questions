/*Bitland's classic programming language is called Bit++. This language has a unique and complex structure.
 It contains only one variable, which is called "x", and two operations: "++" and "--". 
 The operation "++" increases the value of "x" by 1, and the operation "--" decreases the value of "x" by 1. 
 A statement in Bit++ consists of only one operation and the variable "x", written without spaces.
 Executing a statement means performing the operation it contains.
  A program in Bit++ is a sequence of statements that need to be executed one after the other.
The execution of a program means executing all the statements it contains, starting from an initial value of "x" equal to 0. 
Your task is to execute the program and find the final value of "x" when the program has finished executing.
